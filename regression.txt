assumptions in linear regression:
1.linear relationship between input variables and outcome variable
2.error term is a normally distributed random variable with mean equal to zero and constant variance

for given inputs x1,x2,x3... output variable y is normally distributed with mean b0+b1x1+b2x2..... and variance sigma^2


normality assumption on the error term helps us in performing hypothesis testing on the linear regression model and to provide confidence intervals on the parameters and mean of y given x1,x2...



p value denotes the probability of associated hypothesis test value(t value) assuming null hypothesis. if it is small, null hypothesis should be rejected. if the p value is large, the variable causing such high probability should be rejected from the data. as high probability denotes that null hypotheisis shouldnt be rejected and the correspoding variable has not affect on the dependent variable output
